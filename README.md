# Ray Tracing in One Weekend 

- Starting [ray tracing in one weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) to play with OCaml. Not sure how far we will go but it looks fun so we want to give it a try...
- Run it: `dune exec raytracing`

## Progress...

- We are currently doing [4.1 The ray Class](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html#rays,asimplecamera,andbackground/therayclass)
